WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/xin/Documents/RL4REC/RC15/GRU_PRL.py:68: GRUCell.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.rnn_cell_impl) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
This class is equivalent as tf.keras.layers.GRUCell, and will be replaced by that in Tensorflow 2.0.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/xin/Documents/RL4REC/RC15/GRU_PRL.py:71: dynamic_rnn (from tensorflow.python.ops.rnn) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `keras.layers.RNN(cell)`, which is equivalent to this API
WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/xin/miniconda3/envs/tf-1.15/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/ops/rnn_cell_impl.py:559: Layer.add_variable (from tensorflow.python.keras.engine.base_layer) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `layer.add_weight` method instead.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/xin/miniconda3/envs/tf-1.15/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/ops/rnn_cell_impl.py:565: calling Constant.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.init_ops) with dtype is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Call initializer instance with the dtype argument instead of passing it to the constructor
WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/xin/miniconda3/envs/tf-1.15/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_core/python/ops/rnn_cell_impl.py:575: calling Zeros.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.init_ops) with dtype is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Call initializer instance with the dtype argument instead of passing it to the constructor

Instructions for updating:
Use tf.where in 2.0, which has the same broadcast rule as np.where
WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/xin/Documents/RL4REC/RC15/GRU_PRL.py:84: dropout (from tensorflow.python.layers.core) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use keras.layers.dropout instead.
